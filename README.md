## üè´ Problem Background

Universities with MBA programs face challenges in maximizing graduate job placement rates and effectively supporting students to excel in their careers. The main issue is the lack of data-driven understanding of how specific academic and non-academic factors influence placement success. Without these insights, it becomes difficult to:

- Identify tailored advice for students
- Optimize internal resource allocation
- Boost overall placement numbers

This project addresses these challenges by developing a predictive tool that assesses the likelihood of job placement for MBA students based on their academic performance, demographic information, and work experience.

## üöÄ Project Output

The project delivers:

1. **Predictive Model**: An XGBoost classification model that predicts whether an MBA student will secure job placement
1. **Web Application**: A Streamlit-based interactive application deployed on HuggingFace for real-time predictions
1. **Comprehensive Analysis**: Detailed exploratory data analysis revealing key factors influencing placement success
1. **Model Performance**: Baseline and hyperparameter-tuned models with detailed evaluation metrics

## üìä Data

**Dataset**: Campus Recruitment Dataset from Kaggle

- **Source**: Kaggle - Factors Affecting Campus Placement
- **Size**: 215 students, 14 features
- **Features**:
  - Academic Performance: Secondary school percentage, higher secondary percentage, degree percentage, entrance test percentage, MBA percentage
  - Demographic Information: Gender, secondary school board, higher secondary board, specialization, degree type
  - Work Experience: Prior work experience (Yes/No)
  - Target Variables: Placement status (Placed/Not Placed), Salary (for placed students)

**Data Quality**: 
- No missing values except in salary column (expected for non-placed students)
- Well-balanced mix of categorical and numerical features
- Clean data requiring minimal preprocessing

## üõ†Ô∏è Method

The project follows a comprehensive machine learning pipeline:

### 1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

- Distribution analysis of categorical and numerical features
- Correlation analysis between features
- Target variable analysis (placement status distribution)
- Feature importance identification through visualization

### 2. **Feature Engineering**

- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Handling missing values in salary column
- Feature encoding for categorical variables
- Data scaling and normalization
- Train-test split (80-20)

### 3. **Model Development**

- **Baseline Models**: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree, KNN, SVM, XGBoost
- **Model Selection**: Cross-validation with 5-fold CV
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: GridSearchCV for XGBoost optimization
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, ROC-AUC

### 4. **Model Performance**

- **Best Model**: XGBoost (Baseline version)
- **Performance Metrics**:
  - Accuracy: 86%
  - Recall: 96%
  - Precision: 85%
  - F1-Score: 90%
  - ROC-AUC: 91%

## üí° Key Findings

1. **Academic Performance**: Higher academic scores across all levels significantly improve placement chances
1. **Work Experience**: Students with prior work experience have better placement rates
1. **Degree Type**: Certain degree specializations show higher placement success
1. **Gender Distribution**: Slight gender imbalance in the dataset
1. **Model Performance**: XGBoost outperformed other algorithms in predicting placement success
